# Responding to PR reviews

Once you get a review, these are the guidelines to follow.

## Address all observations

Address all review observations. That doesn't mean you should change your code on
all observations but you should respond to all of them with a informative comment so
the reviewer knows what you did (addressed the changes, have questions about their
observations, etc.)

## **Do not** mark the conversations as resolved

The reviewer is responsible for making conversations as resolved.
